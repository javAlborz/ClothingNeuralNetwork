# Clothing Neural Network (CNN*)

## Description

This project is a deep learning application for image inference. Given an input image, it resizes the image, runs inference using a pre-trained deep learning model, and visualizes the results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Libraries and packages: OpenCV, PIL, PyTorch, torchvision, etc.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd path-to-project-directory
    ```
3. Install the required packages and libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
    ```

## Usage

### Image Inference

1. Run the main script with the path to the input image:
    ```bash
    python main.py path-to-input-image
    ```
2. Optionally, skip the image resizing step by adding the `--skip_resize` flag:
    ```bash
    python main.py path-to-input-image --skip_resize
    ```
